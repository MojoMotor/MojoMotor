# MojoMotor
The Publishing Engine that Does Less!

## Project Status:

Howdy, and thanks for looking at a fascinating bit of internet history!  MojoMotor was a fun, quirky little CMS from about 2010 -- Recently (2020) I emailed with Rick Ellis formerly of Ellis Labs, and as MojoMotor was long since abandoned, he offered to transfer all rights over and signed off on relicensing it to GPL.

So, that's what I'm working on right now.  Getting the codebase tidied to relicense, tested with varying versions of PHP (it doesn't currently function under stable, supported PHP releases) and -- if nothing else -- serving as a public, free archive of a neat piece of internet history.

Thanks for stopping by, any input is of course welcome!
